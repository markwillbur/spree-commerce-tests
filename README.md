# üõçÔ∏è Spree Commerce Playwright Tests

This repo contains automated tests for the [Spree Commerce Demo Store](https://demo.spreecommerce.org/) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

The goal was to write end-to-end UI tests based on a QE code challenge. The tests simulate a user shopping on the site, from signing up to completing a full purchase with payment.

## ‚úÖ What's Included

There is one test file for the full end to end test in this project:

**Full E2E Test** (spreecommerce-tests.spec.ts)
   - Creates a new user account using random credentials.
   - Saves the credentials for later use in the next test.
   - Logs in with the user created during sign-up.
   - Adds a product to the cart.
   - Verifies product details (name, size, price).
   - Proceeds through checkout:
     - Fills in a shipping address (if user is new)
     - Selects a delivery option
     - Enters test credit card info (if user has not setup via Stripe)
     - Submits the order
   - Verifies that the order confirmation page is shown with a success message.

Each important step (navigation, URL, UI text, etc.) has assertions to make sure things are working as expected.
